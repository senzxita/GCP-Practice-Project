# LAB: Console and Cloud Shell

## Objectives:
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:
	* Get access to Google Cloud.
	* Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.
	* Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.
	* Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.

### Objective One : Get access to Google Cloud
-Steps:

1. Sign in to Qwiklabs, take note of the lab's access time and ensure you finish within the stipulated period.  
2. Click "Start Lab". 
3. Click "Open Google Console".
4. Enter the lab credentials provided to sign in to Cloud Platform Console.
5. Accept the terms and skip recovery resource page.

Note: Do not click "End Lab" until you are done working on the lab or you want to restart the lab. Restarting the lab clears your work and remove the project.
Another lab credentials are generated when you repeat Step 1.


### Objective Two: Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console
Note: This is the translation of Cloud Console instructions to 100% command line instructions.

-Steps:
1. Open Cloud shell, create your first bucket using 'gsutil' command.
	gsutil mb gs://my_first_bucket_3ca8c
2. To verify 'my_first_bucket' has been created, enter the gsutil ls, to list the buckets in a project.
	gsutil ls
RESULT:
	gs://my_first_bucket_3ca8c/

### Objective Three: Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell
-Steps:

1. Open Cloud shell, create your second bucket.
	gsutil mb gs://my_second_bucket_3ca8c
2. Verify 'my_second_bucket' has been created.
	gsutil ls
RESULT:
	gs://my_first_bucket_3ca8c/
	gs://my_second_bucket_3ca8c/

### Objective Four: Become familiar with Cloud Shell features
Task 1: Upload a File
-Steps:
1. Click on the three dots icon that is aligned vertically, in the Cloud Shell toolbal
2. Options are being displayed, select "Upload File"
3. Upload any file from your local machine to Cloud Shell.
4. To confirm the file was uploaded, type 'ls' in Cloud Shell
	ls
RESULT:
	logo.PNG  README-cloudshell.txt

5.Copy the file uploaded into my_first_bucket
	gsutil cp 'logo.PNG' gs://my_first_bucket_3ca8c 

Task 2: Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell
-Steps:
1. Create an environment variable and place it in a region
	INFRACLASS_REGION=us-central1
2. Verify the environment variable is in your chosen region
	echo $INFRACLASS_REGION
RESULT:
	us-central1
3. Create a subdirectory
	mkdir infraclass
4. Create 'config' file in the infraclass directory
	touch infraclass/config
5. Add us-central1 to 'config' file
	echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config
6.Create a second environment variable for your project 'qwiklabs-gcp-01-3ca8c0398cc1'
	INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=qwiklabs-gcp-01-3ca8c0398cc1
7. Add qwiklabs-gcp-01-3ca8c0398cc1 to the 'config' file.
	echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config
8. Use source command to set the environment variables
	source infraclass/config
9. Use echo command to verify the project variable was set
	echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
RESULT: 
	qwiklabs-gcp-01-3ca8c0398cc1

Task 3: Modify The bash profile and create persistence
-Steps
1. Edit the shell profile, enter nano command
	nano .profile
2. Add source command to the end of the file in nano
	source infraclass/config
3. Enter Ctrl+O, Enter to save the file
4. Enter Ctrl+X to exit nano
5. Close and reopen Cloud Shell 
6. Use echo command to verify the variable is still set
	echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
RESULT:
	qwiklabs-gcp-01-3ca8c0398cc1
7. Enter 'exit' command to close Cloud Shell
	exit
